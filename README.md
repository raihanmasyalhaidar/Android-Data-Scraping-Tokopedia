## Overview
At the beginning of 2025, the smartphone market in Indonesia, particularly for Android devices, continues to experience rapid growth, with various brands and models competing in the market. E-commerce platforms like Tokopedia have become one of the main channels for consumers to purchase Android devices. However, the ever-changing dynamics of the Indonesian Android market, such as price trends, demand, and product variations, are not always clearly reflected in the readily available data. Therefore, this project aims to perform data scraping on Tokopedia to analyze the dynamics of the Android market in Indonesia at the beginning of 2025.

## Objectives
#### 1. Identify statistics of Android smartphones on the Tokopedia marketplace
This objective is to examine the price distribution, units sold, and ratings from the data scraped from Tokopedia

#### 2. Analyze the price distribution of Android smartphones on Tokopedia
This objective is to analyze the price range where most smartphones are found and observe consumer preferences in purchasing Android smartphones based on price

#### 3. Determine the best-selling brands on Tokopedia.
This objective is to identify which brands are the best-selling in the Tokopedia marketplace for Android smartphones

#### 4. Identify stores and their locations with the highest number of Android smartphone buyers
This objective is to identify the stores and locations that are the most popular choices for consumers when purchasing Android smartphones

#### 5. Analyze product ratings of purchased brands
This objective is to analyze the ratings of each brand based on their products and sales on the Tokopedia marketplace

#### 6. Identify the most purchased Android smartphones on Tokopedia

## Dataset
The data used in this project is obtained from the Tokopedia Marketplace, consisting of product name, brand, price, units sold, rating, store, and store location. The data is collected using web scraping techniques to access product data on Tokopedia, utilizing Python with the BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries to scrape the data from Tokopedia.

## Summary
The Android smartphone market in Indonesia at the beginning of 2025 is dominated by products in the price range of 1-3 million IDR, with significant interest also in the flagship segment (above 10 million IDR). Samsung and Xiaomi are the two leading brands, dominating both in terms of the number of products, sales figures, and popularity on the Tokopedia marketplace, with sales of 198,218 units and 173,549 units, respectively. Some consumers prefer to buy from Official Stores, as evidenced by the dominance of Xiaomi Official Store (76,000 units) and Samsung Official Store (42,446 units), although some non-official stores still have high sales figures. The majority of products do not support Cash on Delivery (COD), likely due to the high payment risk for sellers. Meanwhile, Central Jakarta recorded the highest sales figures (177,308 units), confirming its position as the main trading hub. The Samsung Galaxy A05s became the best-selling product (14,050 units), indicating strong demand in the 2-3 million IDR segment, while in the 1-2 million IDR and 5-6 million IDR segments, Xiaomi products like the Poco M6 and Poco F6 dominate. Overall, the Android smartphone market in Indonesia is highly competitive, with marketing strategies needing to be tailored to price segmentation and consumer preferences.
